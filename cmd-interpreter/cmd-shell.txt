Shell access

import os
class shell_cmd(cmd.Cmd,object):
    def do_shell(self, s):
        os.system(s)
    def help_shell(self):
        print "execute shell commands"
By deriving from this class, you will be able to execute any shell command:

(Cmd) ! ls /usr/local/lib/python2.2/config
Makefile Setup.config config.c install-sh makesetup Setup
Setup.local config.c.in libpython2.2.a python.o
By the way, the cmd module understands
the ! character as a shortcut for the shell command and the ? character for help
